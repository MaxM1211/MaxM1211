Hi, Iâ€™m @MaxM1211

Iâ€™m interested in very much every programming language. I've written code in:
- Python
- C, C++, C#
- Java
- PHP, HTML, JS, CSS (HTML is not a programing language I know)
- Visal Basic, VBA
- Visual Age: Smalltalk (But don't ever ask me to do this again ðŸ’©)
- ...

Some projects are:
- Website & DB for GTA Roleplay (Storage Management)
- Own discord server with its own bot. Features are added to the bot whenever something is requested.
  - Star Citizen Fleet
  - Welcome Message
  - Dynamic Presence
  - Twitch Alerts
  - Music from Radio Streams
- Future: Android application, which will help you in some way... ðŸ¥ž

 I'm contributing to:
 - [Star Citizen German Translation](https://github.com/rjcncpt/StarCitizen-Deutsch-INI): I'm mainly responsible for the GitHub management and GitHub actions.
